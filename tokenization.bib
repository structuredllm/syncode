  abstract =	 "Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is a popular algorithm used for
                  tokenizing data in NLP, despite being devised initially as a
                  compression method.BPE appears to be a greedy algorithm at
                  face value, but the underlying optimization problem that BPE
                  seeks to solve has not yet been laid down. We formalize BPE
                  as a combinatorial optimization problem. Via submodular
                  functions, we prove that the iterative greedy version is a
                  1/sigma*(1-e(-sigma))-approximation of an optimal merge
                  sequence, where sigma is the total backward curvature with
                  respect to the optimal merge sequence. Empirically the lower
                  bound of the approximation is approx0.37.We provide a faster
                  implementation of BPE which improves the runtime complexity
                  from O(NM) to O(N log M), where N is the sequence length and
                  M is the merge count. Finally, we optimize the brute-force
                  algorithm for optimal BPE using memoization."
